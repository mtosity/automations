### Baidu, Inc. (BIDU) Investment Analysis  
**Executive Summary**  
Baidu, China's dominant search engine and AI leader, faces near-term headwinds but retains strong fundamentals. Despite regulatory pressures and slowing revenue growth (-2.2% YoY in Q1 2025), its robust cash position ($20B+), low debt (Debt/Equity: 0.30), and leadership in AI/cloud services offer long-term potential. Technicals show oversold conditions, and valuation metrics signal undervaluation. **Recommendation: BUY** for patient investors, targeting **$105/share** (22% upside) within 1–2 years.

### Investment Recommendation  
**Recommendation**: **BUY**  
- **Price Target**: **$105** (based on 12x 2026 EPS of $8.75).  
- **Catalysts**: AI monetization, iQIYI profitability, market share gains in cloud.  
- **Time Horizon**: 1–2 years.  

**Rationale**:  
- Valuation disconnect: P/E of 9x vs. sector avg 15x.  
- Technical setup suggests rebound potential.  
- $20B cash hoard enables share buybacks (5% yield in 2024).  

**Action**: Accumulate below $87; monitor Q2 earnings (August) for revenue inflection.  

---  
**Final Note**: Baidu is a contrarian play on China’s digital economy. While near-term volatility persists, its AI leadership and balance sheet offer asymmetric upside.
